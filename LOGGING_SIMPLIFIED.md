# Logging System - Simplified Console-Only ✅

## Overview
The logging system has been simplified for Docker deployment using **console-only logging**. All log output is captured by Docker's logging driver, eliminating the need for file-based logging and potential permission issues.

## Key Features
- **Console-only output**: All logs go to stdout/stderr
- **Docker log capture**: Use `docker-compose logs -f telegram-bot` to view logs
- **No file permissions**: Eliminates Docker permission issues with log files
- **Centralized management**: Logs are managed by Docker's logging infrastructure
- **Performance decorators**: Function execution time tracking still available
- **User interaction logging**: User activity tracking through console output

## Configuration
- Single environment variable: `LOG_LEVEL` (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Simplified logging setup in `app/utils/logging.py`
- No log directories or file rotations needed

## Usage
```bash
# View live logs
docker-compose logs -f telegram-bot

# View recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=100 telegram-bot

# Follow logs with timestamps
docker-compose logs -f -t telegram-bot
```

## Benefits
- ✅ No Docker permission issues
- ✅ Simpler container deployment  
- ✅ Standard Docker logging patterns
- ✅ Easy log aggregation and monitoring
- ✅ Reduced container complexity
- ✅ Better for production deployments

## Components
- `app/utils/logging.py`: Console-only setup with performance decorators
- `test_logging_system.py`: Updated test script for console logging
- Docker containers: Capture and manage all log output automatically

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
Console-only logging system is fully implemented and ready for production use.
